Son unos controles muy sencillos para sintetizar.
El entorno era muy intuitivo.
","Había cosas que podía agarrar y no debería (como el coche o la cabina de teléfono)
Algunos interactuables como la puerta del coche o el teléfono se me hace raro que sea una interacción de botón de acción y no de grabbeable.
La falta de poses predeterminadas al agarrar un objeto me hacían que me fuese muy difícil tener el objeto bien agarrado.","Más reacciones de los elementos del escenario frente a lo que está sucediendo, como que haya una persona cruzando una carretera.
Interacciones más realistas como abrir físicamente la puerta del coche o que se abra desde la parte de atrás.","Moderadamente","Ligeramente","Fuertemente","Predominantemente"
